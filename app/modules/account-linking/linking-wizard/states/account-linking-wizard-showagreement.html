      <h4>Cisco Spark Agreement</h4>
      <p>
        Please read the agreement thoroughly and accept below. This will give you 3 months to verify you own the domains by entering a TXT record in your DNS.

        <p>
          As an administrator of the WebEx site for your organization you are agreeing to the following by electronically signing this agreement: -
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) the users that you are importing are valid users who are members of your organization, accordingly you have the right to manage them;
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) Upon importing these users to Cisco Spark, users who are linked through this process will share personal profile information and content on the Spark Platform. Accordingly, the Cisco Terms of Service and Privacy Policy will apply. You are hereby accepting
          these terms on behalf of your organization and the users you link in this process. –
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) You, as the administrator, are being given a 3-month grace period to verify the domains listed in the wizard via the DNS Txt entry feature in the “settings” section of Spark Control Hub. If you fail to verify domains within that 3-month grace period,
          Cisco Spark may discontinue the auto sync and linking of accounts for the user domains not verified via the “verify domain” feature in the security settings of control hub. Those users will no longer have access to Cisco Spark through your subscription,
          and that failure to access will not be considered a breach by Cisco.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) Users from consumer domains or any domain not in the admin’s verified list will be sent an email from Cisco to verify their user account. For example purposes only, domains that fall into this category are gmail.com, yahoo.com, sina.com, or consumer
          services that do not specifically represent a company domain. Additionally, Cisco may decide to verify the authenticity of a user’s email address for any other reason. –
        </p>
        <p>
          (5) If you choose to turn on the Automatic Link feature in Spark Control Hub, all new users you create on the WebEx Site Administration will be created and linked automatically on the Spark Platform.

12.	Term and Termination.

a.	Term and Termination of Orders.  The “Initial Term” of an Order starts on the date the Services are available for use by You and lasts for the time period stated in the Order.  After the Initial Term, unless prohibited by applicable law or the Order states otherwise, there will be an automatic “Renewal Term” of the same length of time unless You notify Us in writing that You do not want to renew the Services at least 30 days before the end of the Initial or then current Renewal Term.  If the fees will change for the Renewal Term, Cisco will notify You reasonably in advance of the Renewal, and in time for You to accept or reject renewing the Services.  If You agree with the fee changes, You may do nothing and the new fees will apply for the upcoming Renewal Term.  Either party may terminate an Order for convenience by providing the other party written notice of termination at least 30 days before the end of such Initial or Renewal Term.  The termination will be effective on the last day of the Initial or Renewal Term in effect and You will pay for the Services until the end of current Initial or Renewal Term, regardless of when You provided notice.

b.	Term and Termination of Agreement.  This Agreement starts on the date You submit Your first Order.  Either party may terminate this Agreement upon 30 days prior written notice to the other party, with or without cause, effective when all of Your Orders expire or are terminated.  Each party may terminate this Agreement and any impacted Orders by giving written notice to the other party if the other party materially breaches this Agreement and does not cure that breach within 30 days after receiving written notice of the breach.

c.	Events Upon Termination.  If this Agreement is terminated for any reason, subject to the Cisco Acceptable Use Policy (described below): (i) We will make Your lawful Content available to You for a reasonable period of time and (ii) You will pay Us for the Services(s) provided up to the date of termination.

d.	Survival.

As a part of that compliance, We will use at least industry standard technical, procedural and physical means to protect against unauthorized access, use or disclosure of Personal Information.

We will make commercially reasonable efforts to notify You before taking such actions so that You can remedy the issue.  However, We reserve the right to act immediately if We reasonably believe that allowing such Content or use of the Services would expose Us to civil, regulatory or criminal liability.  You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Us from any and all third party claims, liability, damages and/or costs (including, but not limited to, attorneys’ fees) arising from Your or Your Users’ violation of the AUP.

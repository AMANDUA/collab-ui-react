## Overview

The code is pushed to **[integration](https://int-admin.ciscospark.com)** after each successful build on [Gauntlet](https://gauntlet.wbx2.com/queue.html?queue=atlas-web)/[Jenkins](https://sqbu-jenkins.cisco.com:8443/job/team/job/atlas/job/atlas-web/).

Atlas UI, Atlas backend and a few other services are deployed to **[production](https://admin.ciscospark.com)** each **working day at 3:02 PM Pacific time** (Los Angeles timezone). Atlas UI is deployed **last**, so approximately around **4:17 PM** the deploy script will check the latest build that has been "gold starred" and deploy it.

Several people can "gold star" a build (mark a successful build with a gold star), but usually [Michael McCann](http://wwwin-tools.cisco.com/dir/reports/mrmccann) takes care of it every US working day.

## Finding which build is currently in integration

Look for the latest green build on [Jenkins](https://sqbu-jenkins.cisco.com:8443/job/team/job/atlas/job/atlas-web/).

## Finding which build is currently in production

Search in the room *Atlas UI Build Pipeline* for "production" and click on the first result. The message is highlighted and its last line contains the current build number (build 14749 in this case):

![production-search](https://sqbu-github.cisco.com/storage/user/357/files/8dce0854-07fc-11e7-8927-24f2da3a73e5)

## Finding the latest "gold starred" build

Look at the "Ready for Prod" section on [Jenkins' Promotion page](https://sqbu-jenkins.cisco.com:8443/job/team/job/atlas/job/atlas-web/promotion/):

![ready-for-prod](https://sqbu-github.cisco.com/storage/user/357/files/83820710-07fc-11e7-8beb-7fe8848b2058)

## Asking for a specific build to be pushed to production

There's no need for that, a build is generally "gold starred" every work day.

If there is a bug in production **impacting customers**, or if you know that the current "gold starred" build contains such a bug, mention it in the Spark Room "Atlas UI Dev Team". [Wouter Lammers](http://wwwin-tools.cisco.com/dir/reports/woulamme) and [Thomas Bassetto](http://wwwin-tools.cisco.com/dir/reports/thobasse) can "gold star" builds during Norwegian office hours.

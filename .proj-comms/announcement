## Notice to all contributors:

There have been a couple changes to unit test execution:

- code coverage is disabled by default
  - can be enabled with the `--env.coverage` flag
  - coverage instrumentation is resource-intensive
  - most users don't check coverage on every test run, but can still enable when desired
  - coverage is still generated and calculated for Jenkins builds

- karma default browser changed to headless Chrome
  - behavior more aligned with full Chrome browser used in debug mode
  - executes tests faster and is more responsive
  - can be remotely debugged with chrome://inspect
  - if needed, can fallback to PhantomJS with `--phantomjs` flag

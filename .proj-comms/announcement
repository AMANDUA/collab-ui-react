## Notice to all contributors:

We are switching to `yarn` for managing our npm dependencies going forward. If
you haven't already done so you'll want to take a moment to do that now before
you continue on with your regularly scheduled programming.

#### How do I install it?

Install it by either running:

```
./setup.sh
```

...or if you prefer to install it directly, upstream-provided instructions can
be found here:

https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/

IMPORTANT: please make sure you are using the latest version of node 6.x

#### Okay I've installed it, now what?

Use `yarn` where you used to use `npm`. Here are some examples:

```
# re-sync npm dependencies
yarn  # <= npm install

# start the dev server
yarn serve  # <= npm run serve

# run lint
yarn lint  # <= npm run lint

# run unit-tests
yarn test  # <= npm run test

# run protractor tests
yarn protractor  # <= npm run protractor
```

More commands can be found at: './docs/npm-scripts.md'

#### I've got more questions!

Sure thing, feel free to ask them in the 'Atlas UI Dev Team' room.
